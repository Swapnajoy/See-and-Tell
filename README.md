# See-and-Tell
A Vision-Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VLM-RAG).

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project explores **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, specifically for vision-language tasks, where the model generates captions for images by leveraging both the image content and relevant textual information retrieved from an external knowledge base.

The **T5** model is used as the **text encoder**, which processes the query text and generates the final caption. The **ViT (Vision Transformer)** is used as the **image encoder**, which extracts meaningful features from the image. These embeddings from both the text and image are then fused with additional information from a retrieval system, making the model more contextually aware.

Key features of this implementation:
- **Image and text encoding**: The image is encoded using **ViT**, and the text is encoded using **T5**.
- **Retrieval-enhanced captioning**: Uses a retrieval-based mechanism to inject relevant external knowledge into captions.
- **Learnable fusion weights**: The fusion of text, image, and retrieval vectors is controlled by learnable parameters.
- **Robust training**: Techniques such as dropout and distractor retrieval are employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this project was to enhance traditional image captioning by integrating retrieval-augmented generation. By using external knowledge through retrieval, I aimed to **generate more relevant and context-aware captions** for images, especially in cases where captions require knowledge beyond what is directly visible in the image.

Through this project, I learned several key concepts:
- **Text-to-text transformers (T5)** are extremely effective at generating coherent text from a variety of inputs.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)** provide powerful image representations, which can be directly leveraged for multimodal tasks.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation** is a powerful technique for improving captioning and other language generation tasks, where external information is needed.
- Fine-tuning and training complex models with **multimodal inputs** and retrieval components require careful handling of overfitting, data diversity, and proper training strategies.

This project served as both a practical exercise in working with **transformer-based models** and a deep dive into the **retrieval-augmented generation** paradigm.
